## Introduction
This project is an image classification application built with Flask. It allows users to upload images and receive predictions from a pre-trained machine-learning model.

## Features
- Image upload for classification
- Real-time predictions
- User-friendly web interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Flask
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning library of your choice)
- Fastai (list them if any)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nitish0710/Image-classification-using-Flask.git
    cd your_project_name
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - For Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - For macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.
